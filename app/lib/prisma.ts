import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

// In development, the command next dev clears Node.js cache on run. This in turn initializes a new PrismaClient instance each time due to hot reloading that creates a connection to the database. This can quickly exhaust the database connections as each PrismaClient instance holds its own connection pool.

// The solution in this case is to instantiate a single instance PrismaClient and save it on the globalThis object. Then we keep a check to only instantiate PrismaClient if it's not on the globalThis object otherwise use the same instance again if already present to prevent instantiating extra PrismaClient instances.

declare global {
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

const client = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalThis.prisma = client;

export default client;
